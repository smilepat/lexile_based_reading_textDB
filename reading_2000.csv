1,Why Are Teenagers Crazy about Bubble Tea?,"Jisoo had never tried bubble tea until her friend gave her a sip at lunch. The drink was cold and sweet, and the tapioca balls were so fun to chew.

Since that day, she has gone to bubble tea shops every weekend. She tries new flavors and often posts pictures of her drinks online. Her favorite so far has been brown sugar with extra pearls.

Last Saturday, she met some friends at a new shop that had just opened. They laughed, took selfies, and shared sips from each other’s cups. If she hadn’t tried it that first time, she might never have realized how fun it could be. For Jisoo and many other teens, bubble tea isn’t just a drink—it’s part of their weekend adventure."
2,Why Do People Love the Holidays?,"Have you ever wondered why so many people smile more during the holidays? Christmas is a time when cities glow with colorful lights, and people exchange gifts to show love and care. Many children wait excitedly for Santa, who is said to bring presents to those who have behaved well.

Families gather to eat delicious food, decorate trees, and enjoy music together. Some people like to watch classic Christmas movies or drink hot chocolate by the fire. Others give to those in need because they want to share joy.

Even if it’s cold outside, the warm feeling in people’s hearts makes the season special. That may be why Christmas has been loved by so many for generations—and why it still brings happiness today."
3,Sticker Photo Culture: Why Do We Enjoy Taking Sticker Photos?,"Sticker photo booths have become a big part of Korean teen culture. You can find them almost everywhere—on busy streets, malls, and schools. There are over 3,000 booths across Korea, and their number keeps growing.

Many students enjoy decorating their photos with cute frames, stickers, and fun effects. These photos aren’t just pictures—they show who we are and how we express ourselves. Recently, sticker photos have become popular with foreign tourists, too. Many visitors try them when they come to Korea because it’s a fun and unique way to make memories with friends.

Sticker photos turn small moments into something special. If you’ve taken one before, you probably still remember how fun it was. And if you haven’t, maybe it’s time to try!"
4,Why Is Retro Style Cool Again?,"Hana: Hey, is that a cassette player?

Jisoo: Yup! It was my dad’s. I found it in the closet, and it still works!

Hana: That’s so cool. Retro stuff is everywhere lately. I’ve even seen people wearing 90s windbreakers.

Jisoo: I know. I’ve been listening to old K-pop songs, and some of them sound better than the new ones.

Hana: I’ve started wearing my mom’s vintage jeans. At first, I thought people would laugh, but they actually said I looked trendy.

Jisoo: If we had worn this stuff a few years ago, people might’ve thought we were weird. Now it’s in style!

Hana: Retro just has a different vibe. It feels more fun and original.

Jisoo: Totally. I love mixing old and new. It’s like bringing history back—with a twist."
5,Día de los Muertos: How Do Mexicans Celebrate Life Through Memory?,"One of the most unique festivals in Mexico is Día de los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead. It is celebrated on November 1st and 2nd to honor family members who have passed away. Instead of being sad, this festival is colorful and full of life.

Families build altars at home and decorate them with flowers, candles, food, and photos of loved ones. People also visit graves, bring gifts, and share stories. It’s a time to remember, not to cry.

Skulls made of sugar and skeleton decorations are typical but not scary—they’re symbols of love and memory. Día de los Muertos shows that remembering someone can be beautiful. This festival teaches us that love continues, even after someone is gone."
6,Digital Detox: Can You Live Without Your Phone?,"Imagine a whole day without your phone—no chatting, no games, no videos—just real life. Sounds difficult, right? But some people say a digital detox is the best way to feel sound again.

Many students check their phones every few minutes. I’ve done it too. But when I tried one day without my phone, I was surprised. I had more time to communicate with my family, go outside, and even finish my homework faster. It felt good!

Of course, phones are useful. We need them for school, music, and staying in touch. But if we use them too much, we might miss the world around us. You might think, ""I can’t live without it!"" But you never know—maybe you can. Try a short digital detox. You might enjoy it more than you expect."
7,What Brings Yuna’s Break from Social Media?,"Yuna used to check her phone every few minutes. She posted selfies, watched videos, and counted how many likes she got. When her friends didn’t comment, she felt a little disappointed. Maybe I’m not interesting enough, she thought.

One day, her phone broke. At first, she panicked. ""How will I know what’s happening?"" she cried. But after a few days, something changed. She read a book for pleasure. She took a walk without taking pictures. She even communicated more with her family.

When her phone was fixed, she didn’t rush to post. She had realized something important. ""I like social media,"" she said, ""But I don’t need it to be happy."" Yuna still uses her apps, but not all the time. She has found a better balance, and that has made her smile more than any number of likes."
8,How Did K-Pop Become Part of My Life and Everyone Else’s?,"I still remember the first time I heard K-pop. It was BTS’s ""Dynamite,"" and I couldn’t stop dancing. Since then, I’ve watched music videos, learned dances, and even followed fan accounts from other countries. I never expected people in Brazil, Germany, or the U.S. to love K-pop as much as I do—but they really do!

One time, I joined a live concert stream online. Fans from all over the world were cheering in the chat. If you had seen it, you would’ve felt the energy too. Some even typed messages in Korean!

K-pop isn’t just about music. It’s the style, the stories, the teamwork. The more I learn, the more I admire the effort idols put in. They train so hard before they even debut. I smile when I hear K-pop playing in a store or a cafe. It feels like a part of home is everywhere."
9,How Can Minji’s Late-Night Shopping Habit Be Fixed?,"It was 11:45 p.m., and Minji was still scrolling through an online shopping app. ""Only five left in stock!"" the message said. Her finger hovered over the buy button. ""Do I really need this?"" she asked herself. Still, she clicked ""Order.""

The following day, she barely remembered what she had bought. Packages kept arriving—small things like keychains, socks, and notebooks. Her room was filling up, but she didn’t feel excited anymore. One day, her dad asked, ""How many of these things do you actually use?"" Minji looked around and didn’t know what to say. She realized she had been shopping out of boredom, not a necessity.

After that, she made a simple rule: no shopping after 9 p.m. At first, it was hard, but soon, she felt more in control. Online shopping was still fun—but now, she was the one making the decisions, not the app."
10,"One Family, Two Screens: How Family Time Disappears?","Minho sat on the couch, watching a drama on his tablet. His mom entered the room and turned on the TV. ""Aren’t you going to watch with me?"" she asked. Minho smiled. ""I already finished this episode last week,"" he said. ""On Netflix.""

When Minho was younger, his family used to watch shows together every evening. But now, everyone watches something different on their own screens. His sister liked YouTube, and his dad only watched live soccer on TV. Minho realized that things had really shifted.

That night, he missed the feeling of watching the same episode together as a family. He thought that if we didn’t all use OTT separately, maybe we would still watch TV as a family. The next day, he suggested a family movie night—with popcorn and just one screen. Everyone agreed. Streaming was great, but sometimes, sharing the moment was even better."
11,Should Plastic Bags Be Banned Completely?,"Plastic bags are used almost everywhere—in supermarkets, convenience stores, and even at home. But many people now ask: Should they be banned completely?

Those who support the ban say plastic bags are bad for the environment. They are hard to recycle and often end up in the ocean, where animals can get hurt. Banning them could help reduce pollution and protect nature.

However, others believe that banning plastic bags is not the best idea. Some people still need them for carrying wet or heavy items. Small stores may not have enough money to provide eco-friendly bags. Instead of a complete ban, some countries charge a small fee for plastic bags or encourage people to bring their own. So, should plastic bags be banned completely?"
12,Why Do Countries Go to War?,"One day, I saw a video of a girl from Ukraine. She was sitting in a train station, holding her cat and waiting to leave her country. Her school was gone, and she didn’t know when she could go home.

I couldn’t stop thinking about her. What did she do to deserve this? Nothing. She was just caught in a war. That night, I asked my dad why countries fight. He said it’s often about power, fear, or not listening to each other. ""But people like that girl suffer the most,"" he said.

Since then, I’ve started to care more about peace. I used to think war only happened in the past, but now I know it’s real—even today. Maybe if more people understand how war affects real lives, they’ll try harder to choose peace over violence."
13,Why Are Short Videos So Popular?,"Short videos are everywhere. People watch them on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. But why do so many people enjoy them? One reason is that short videos are easy to watch. Even if someone has only a few minutes, they can still enjoy a full video. Many videos are funny or exciting, which makes people want to keep watching more.

Some short videos are educational, too. You can learn how to cook, dance, or solve a math problem in less than a minute. Also, creators use fun music, fast editing, and eye-catching effects. These tricks help the video stay in your mind.

However, watching too many short videos can be a problem. It might become hard to focus on longer tasks, like studying or reading. Although short videos are small, their impact can be both good and bad. They often leave a strong effect on how people spend their time."
14,Eastern vs. Western Superheroes: What’s the Difference?,"One night, my friend and I argued about who was cooler—Iron Man or Goku. He said Western superheroes are the best because they save the world with cool suits and big explosions. I said Eastern heroes are better because they grow stronger through training and never give up.

We ended up watching both kinds. The hero flew into space to stop a giant robot in one movie. On the other, the character trained every day, made mistakes, and protected his friends from danger. They were so different, but both were exciting.

After that, we realized something. Western heroes often fight huge battles to save everyone. Eastern heroes usually focus on becoming better and protecting the people close to them. In the end, we both agreed: no matter where they’re from, superheroes inspire us to be brave, kind, and strong—even when life gets hard."
15,Why Is Korean Literature Getting Global Attention?,"""Did you hear the news?"" Jisoo ran into the classroom, waving her phone. ""Han Kang won the Nobel Prize in Literature!"" Mina’s eyes widened. ""Seriously? That’s amazing! I read The Vegetarian last year. It was so unique.""

""I know! She’s the first Korean author to win the prize,"" Jisoo said proudly. ""People all over the world are talking about Korean literature now."" Mina smiled. ""I guess K-literature is joining K-pop and K-dramas in the spotlight.""

""Exactly! Korean stories are deep and emotional. They talk about things like family, identity, and pain,"" Jisoo explained. ""More books are being translated into English so that international readers can enjoy them too."" ""I want to read more Korean novels in English,"" Mina said. ""It feels good to see our culture being recognized."" Jisoo nodded. ""Same here. It makes me proud to be Korean."""
16,Can Virtual Travel Be as Exciting as the Real Thing?,"Today, we can explore the world in two ways: by traveling or by using technology. Some people have visited famous places like the Taj Mahal through virtual tours. I have walked through the streets of Rome using Google Earth, and it felt exciting in its own way.

Actual travel lets you smell, taste, and feel the world. If you visit a place in person, you will remember how the food tastes or how the air feels. But not everyone can travel far. That’s why virtual tools are so useful—they let people explore without spending money or time.

Still, can virtual experiences truly replace real ones? Maybe not. But they can make learning easier and open doors for more people. The more technology grows, the more ways we have to explore. So, which is better—real or virtual? Maybe the best adventures combine both."
17,How Is AI Changing Our Lives?,"Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a technology that helps machines ""think"" and learn like humans. It is already changing the way we live, work, and learn. Many phones use AI to recognize faces or understand voices. Some schools use AI to help students learn faster with personalized lessons.

In hospitals, AI can help doctors find diseases more quickly. Self-driving cars are being tested in some countries, and they use AI to make safe decisions on the road. Even online shopping uses AI to show you items you might prefer.

But AI is not perfect. It can make mistakes, and it can’t feel emotions. People must decide how much they should trust it. AI is a powerful tool, but humans still need to control how it is used. Learning about AI today can help us make wise choices in the future."
18,Can Four Letters Really Describe Who You Are?,"These days, everyone at Minseo’s school seems to be talking about MBTI. During lunch, students compare types like ENFP, ISTJ, or INTP. Some say it explains why certain friends are loud, quiet, organized, or creative.

Minseo has heard people say things like, ""You must be an extrovert—you talk so much!"" or ""Of course she’s a J. She plans everything."" Some teachers have joined in, asking students about their types during group projects. Although MBTI can be fun, Minseo wonders if it’s always accurate. If people are placed into only 16 types, could it leave out parts of who they really are? After all, someone who acts shy today might be outgoing tomorrow.

The test might help people understand themselves better. However, the more students focus on labels, the more they might forget what makes each person different. MBTI is popular—but personalities may be deeper than four letters."
19,Fast Fashion: Is Cheap Clothing Worth the Cost?,"Buying cheap and trendy clothes may seem fun, but fast fashion comes with a hidden cost—and it's not just about money. Behind the low prices, there are serious problems.

Many fast fashion brands use factories where workers are paid very little and work in unsafe conditions. Some workers are even children. They work long hours just so we can wear a shirt once and throw it away. Fast fashion also hurts the Earth. Making clothes fast creates water waste, chemical pollution, and tons of trash. Most of these cheap clothes end up in landfills, where they don’t break down for years. The fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters in the world.

Do we really need ten shirts that fall apart quickly? Or should we buy fewer, better-quality clothes that last longer? Saving money should never come before saving lives—or the planet."
20,Should Students Join Climate Protests?,"Climate change is becoming more serious every year. Ice caps are melting, the weather is getting more extreme, and many animals are losing their homes. Because of this, many students are joining protests to demand action.

One famous example is Greta Thunberg, a student from Sweden. In 2018, she started a school strike to protest the climate. Millions of students worldwide have joined her movement, asking leaders to protect the Earth.

Some people believe students should protest because they are fighting for their future. If no one speaks up, nothing will change. Protesting can bring attention to important problems. However, others argue that students should stay in school. They believe there are other ways to help, like joining eco-clubs or learning how to live more sustainably. Both sides want to save the planet but have different ideas about how to do it. What would you do?"
21,Why Do We Love Minecraft and Roblox So Much?,"One weekend, I spent hours building a huge underwater house in Minecraft. I didn’t follow a guide—I just used my imagination. When I showed it to my friend, he said, ""You should see what I made in Roblox!""

We started sharing our creations and even played games he designed himself. I was amazed. In Roblox, players can be game developers, not just players. In Minecraft, you can create entire worlds from blocks. There are no limits—just ideas.

What I love most is that we can play together. Sometimes, we build, explore, and sometimes laugh at our mistakes. These games aren’t just fun. They let us be creative, think differently, and work as a team. That’s why I keep going back. Every time I play, it feels like I’m building a new story."
22,American English vs. British English: What’s the Difference?,"Have you ever seen someone write ""color"" and someone else writes ""colour""? Both are correct—just from different kinds of English! American English is used in the U.S., while British English is used in the U.K.

Some words look or sound different. Americans say ""elevator,"" but the British say ""lift."" In the U.S., people wear ""sneakers,"" while in the U.K., they wear ""trainers."" Even spelling changes! Americans write ""center,"" but British people write ""centre."" Pronunciation can be different, too. In British English, the ""r"" sound is often softer or silent at the end of words. In American English, it’s stronger.

Sometimes, these differences can be confusing, but don’t worry—both are correct! The most important thing is to understand and be understood. So whether you watch an American movie or read a British book, you still learn English—which really matters."
23,Oops! Was That Rude? Understanding Cultural Differences,"At an international camp, I met Amir from the Middle East. I handed him something with my left hand one day, and he looked surprised. Later, he told me, ""In my culture, we use the right hand for important things."" I felt a bit embarrassed, but he smiled and said, ""Now you know!""

That wasn’t the only time. My Japanese roommate bowed when we met while I tried to high-five him! And when I joked about hair, my Thai friend seemed uncomfortable—I didn’t know touching someone’s head could be rude there.

I used to think being polite was the same everywhere. But now I know that culture shapes how we act and what we expect. Since then, I’ve learned to ask and listen more. Understanding other cultures doesn’t mean being perfect—it means being curious and respectful."
24,Can a Smile Replace a Sentence? The Power of Emojis,"Have you ever sent just a ""smiley face"" emoji instead of a full sentence? Emojis are everywhere—in messages, comments, and even group chats. They’re quick, expressive, and can show emotion without using language.

Some people believe emojis can be a substitute for words. A ""heart"" emoji can mean ""I love this,"" and a ""thumbs-up"" emoji can mean ""OK"" or ""Nice!"" Emojis can even help when people don’t share the same language. But emojis have limits, too. Not everyone interprets them the same way. A ""smirking face"" emoji might seem friendly to one person but rude to another. And for serious topics, words are often more effective.

So, can emojis replace words? Occasionally—but not always. They help add emotion, but they can’t explain everything. Using emojis and words together might be the most thoughtful way to communicate."
25,"""That’s So Fire!"" – The Fun of Slang Words","I was playing a game online when one of the players said, ""That move was sus."" I had no idea what that meant, so I just stayed quiet. Later, I asked my friend Jisoo, and she laughed. ""Sus means suspicious,"" she explained. ""It’s slang—everyone says it!""

After that, I started noticing slang everywhere. People said ""no cap"" when they were being serious or ""fire"" when something was cool. At first, it wasn't very clear, but now I kind of like it. Social media spreads slang quickly. A single funny video can make a word popular in one day. Teenagers often lead the way, creating and sharing new words, but even adults sometimes join in!

Using slang makes conversations more fun. It’s like having your own secret language with friends. I even taught my older brother what ""sus"" means, and now he says it too. The slang keeps changing, but it helps us connect. And honestly? That’s pretty fire."
26,Can One Meal Really Help the Earth?,"Last month, my science teacher gave us a challenge: try eating no meat for one day. At first, I thought, ""That’s easy."" But I didn’t know it had anything to do with the environment.

Later, I learned that raising animals for food uses a lot of land and water. Even worse, cows release gases that hurt the Earth’s air. I was shocked when I learned that livestock farming causes about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions—almost the same as all cars and trucks worldwide.

That night, my family ate tofu stir-fry and vegetable pancakes. It tasted better than I expected. My mom said, ""We don’t have to stop eating meat, but eating less could help."" Now, we try ""Meatless Mondays"" together. I never thought one dinner could help the planet, but maybe it can. Small choices really do matter."
27,Living in a Virtual World: Welcome to the Metaverse,"Have you ever played a game where your character walks, talks, and explores a virtual world? That’s part of the metaverse—a digital space where people can use avatars to meet, learn, play, and even work.

The metaverse is more than just a game. People already use it to attend concerts, try on clothes or design buildings. Some schools in Korea use the metaverse for virtual classes and graduation ceremonies. Companies also hold meetings or job interviews inside 3D offices. Supporters say the metaverse can bring people together from anywhere. You can explore museums, practice languages with foreign friends, or even create your own world.

But not everything is perfect. Some worry about losing face-to-face time or becoming too dependent on screens. Still, the metaverse is growing fast—and it’s already becoming a big part of how we learn, play, and connect in the digital age."
28,More Than Medals: How the Olympics Bring Us Together,"Did you know the modern Olympics began in 1896 to bring nations together through sports? From the beginning, the goal wasn’t just about medals—it was about peace. In the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, two high jumpers—from Qatar and one from Italy—tied in the final. Instead of continuing, they decided to share the gold medal. Their friendship showed that sportsmanship can be stronger than competition.

Another powerful moment happened in 2008. A runner from New Zealand helped a fallen opponent from the U.S. during a race. Although they didn’t win, the world praised them for showing true Olympic spirit. People still remember that moment today.

Stories like these inspire the world. The Olympics let people from different countries meet, respect each other, and even help one another. While the games don’t end wars, they show us what peace can look like—fairness, kindness, and hope."
29,Different But Together: Living in a Multicultural Society,"Have you ever watched K-pop stars speak in different languages or seen actors from mixed backgrounds in your favorite shows? Celebrities like NewJeans’ Danielle (Korean-Australian) and BLACKPINK’s Lisa (from Thailand) are great examples of a multicultural world. They show us that different cultures can unite and create something amazing.

A multicultural society means people from many countries and cultures live in the same place. This is happening more in Korea and around the world. We can enjoy different foods, music, and traditions. But sometimes, people may feel left out or face unfair treatment because of their background.

We should be kind, curious, and respectful when living together. Listening to each other’s stories and learning new things helps us grow. Whether in school or society, everyone deserves to feel like they belong. So, how can we live together? By celebrating what makes us different—and what brings us together."
30,Do Animals Deserve Kindness Too?,"One rainy day, I saw a small dog near the bus stop. It was shaking and hungry. I gave it some food and called a local shelter. They said many animals like this dog are abandoned or mistreated. Some are used in labs, others in shows or farms where they suffer.

That night, I searched online and learned about animal rights. I found out some companies test shampoo by putting chemicals in animals’ eyes. Some animals are kept in small cages their whole lives.

Now, I try to buy ""cruelty-free"" products, which means they were made without testing on animals. I also learned that protecting animals doesn’t mean we stop eating meat or using pets—it means we treat them with care and avoid cruelty. Helping that little dog changed the way I see animals. They may not speak, but they still deserve to be protected."
31,Preparing for the Future: Can We Stop the Next Pandemic?,"Can we stop the next pandemic? A pandemic is a disease that spreads across countries or even the entire world. COVID-19 was a pandemic that changed our daily lives. Schools closed, travel stopped, and many people got sick. It showed how fast a new virus can affect everyone.

To stop a future pandemic, experts say we must be better prepared. Countries should share health information quickly so others can respond faster. Scientists also need to study new viruses and make vaccines. During COVID-19, mRNA vaccines were made faster than ever before—this could help save more lives next time.

Hospitals also need enough workers and supplies. If health systems are stronger, they can help more people. We should also teach people how to stay safe and avoid fake news during emergencies. We may not stop all new diseases, but if we prepare now, we can protect more lives in the future."
32,Farming Without Dirt: Welcome to the Future,"When our science class visited a smart farm, I expected fields and mud. But instead, we stepped into a bright, white building that looked more like a hospital. No soil. No tractors. Just rows of green plants growing under pink and purple lights.

A scientist in a lab coat smiled and said, ""This is vertical farming. These plants grow with LED lights, water mist, and AI sensors."" I looked up and saw tiny robots moving along tracks, checking the leaves. He showed us a screen. ""This system knows exactly when each plant needs light, water, or air. No waste, no chemicals.""

I was amazed. It didn’t smell like a farm. But everything was fresh, clean, and growing fast. On the way back, I thought, maybe farms won’t look like farms anymore—but they’ll still grow the food we eat every day."
33,Flying Helpers: How Drones Are Changing Our World,"Have you ever flown a drone or watched a video from high in the sky? Drones can take amazing photos and videos that were once impossible without helicopters. But today, drones do much more than capture cool views.

In disaster areas, drones search for survivors without risking human lives. In Ukraine, small robots are used to remove landmines safely. At sea, countries like the UK and France use drones to detect dangerous underwater bombs, replacing human divers. Some companies also use drones to inspect bridges and tall buildings, keeping workers out of dangerous situations.

Because drones can fly into risky places, they are now helping humans stay safe. If this technology keeps improving, drones might take over more dangerous jobs in the future. Still, rules must be made for using them safely. Have drones already started to change our lives? In many ways, the answer is ""yes."""
34,"Too Few Babies, Too Many Grandparents? Facing the Future Together","Last week in class, our teacher said Korea's birth rate was just 0.78 in 2022. That means, on average, a woman here is expected to have less than one child. I was shocked! Then, she told us that countries like Japan, Italy, and China also have low birthrates.

She explained that this leads to an aging society. That’s when there are more older people than young ones. It sounds scary. If this continues, there might be fewer students, fewer workers, and more people who need care.

I imagined a future where schools would close, robots would help in hospitals, and younger people would have to work more. Some services might get more challenging to keep running, like hospitals or elderly care, because fewer people will pay taxes. What will our lives look like when we grow up? Will we find clever ways to solve it? I really hope so."
35,What Kind of Impact Do Electric Cars Have on the Environment?,"Last weekend, I saw my uncle’s new electric car for the first time.""Isn’t it cool?"" he said, smiling as the car started without a sound. I had never been in an electric vehicle before, so I was pretty excited. I noticed how quiet and smooth it was as we drove through the neighborhood.

""Electric cars are cleaner, right?"" I asked. He nodded. ""They don’t pollute the air when you drive them. And they can produce 50% fewer emissions over time than gas cars."" But then he added, ""Still, the batteries take a lot of energy to make. And if we use coal-powered electricity, they’re not so green after all.""

That surprised me. I thought electric cars were always clean. ""If we use more solar or wind energy,"" he said, ""They could really help the planet."" I looked out the window and thought, Maybe this quiet car could help us drive toward a cleaner future."
36,What Happens in Our Brain When We Learn a Foreign Language?,"Last year, I started learning English more seriously. At first, it was hard—especially listening and speaking. I kept forgetting words and mixing up grammar. But over time, something strange happened. I could remember new words more quickly, and I was focusing better.

One day, I read that learning a foreign language helps your brain grow stronger. It builds new connections and improves memory and attention. That made sense. I felt like my brain was slowly training, like a muscle at the gym. Now, I have even switched between Korean and English without thinking too much. My teacher says bilingual students often solve problems faster because their brains are more flexible.

Learning English is still challenging, but now I understand what’s happening inside my head. Every time I practice, my brain is growing stronger, making me want to keep going. Learning a language changes more than just how we speak."
37,Why Are Countries Heading Back to Space?,"Have you ever watched The Martian or ET and dreamed about space? These stories feel like science fiction—but space travel is becoming real again. Countries like Korea, the U.S., and India are sending rockets into space. But why?

Some are planning Moon bases. Others are exploring Mars. But space isn’t just about adventure. It helps us here on Earth, too. For example, astronauts on the International Space Station have done experiments to improve medicine, grow plants without soil, and even study Earth’s climate from space.

Their research helps doctors, farmers, and scientists solve real problems. Satellites also guide airplanes, forecast the weather, and connect our phones. In the future, space missions may help us find clean energy or protect Earth from dangerous asteroids. Space is no longer just ""out there."" It’s part of our life—and our future."
38,Low-sugar & Sugar-free Trend: Are They Really Healthy?,"Do you choose Coke Zero or the original when you order fast food? Many students today enjoy zero-sugar drinks like Pepsi Zero, Sprite Zero, or even sugar-free milk tea. These products are popular because they taste sweet but contain little or no sugar. Some people believe they’re healthier and better for weight control.

In fact, for people who are trying to avoid sugar, these drinks can be a wise choice. They allow you to enjoy sweet flavors without raising blood sugar levels. But are they really good for your body? Most of these drinks use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar.

While they have fewer calories, some doctors worry they might confuse your body. You might end up wanting more sweets later. Also, ""zero sugar"" drinks are still high in caffeine or chemicals. So next time you see a sugar-free drink, ask yourself: is it really the healthier choice?"
39,Is Idol Beauty Worth the Price of Health?,"Have you ever heard of an idol eating only one apple a day to lose weight? In K-pop culture, idols are expected to look perfect on stage. To keep that image, some go on extreme diets—even if it harms their health.

Some say it’s part of the job. Idols are always on camera, and their appearance can affect their career. But the real problem is what this creates: a dangerous beauty standard. Many Korean teenagers feel they must look like idols to be seen as beautiful, even if it’s unhealthy.

Extreme dieting can lead to eating disorders, stress, weak immune systems, and even long-term heart or bone problems. It affects both the body and the mind. This issue isn’t just about idols—it’s about the beauty rules set by the industry. Maybe we should ask if these beauty rules are right instead of just following them."
40,Solar Power: Can Sunshine Power Our Future?,"Solar power is one of the fastest-growing energy sources in the world. It works by turning sunlight into electricity using solar panels. These panels can be placed on rooftops or large solar farms.

One famous example is Solar Impulse, a solar-powered airplane that flew around the world without using fuel. In China, a huge solar project called the ""Solar Great Wall"" is being built to help power cities. Solar energy is clean and renewable. It doesn’t release harmful gases like coal or oil. It also reduces our need for fossil fuels.

However, solar power also has some downsides. Solar panels don’t work as well at night or during cloudy weather. Making and recycling panels also uses energy and materials that can affect the environment. Still, many experts believe solar energy will be an important part of our future. The sun gives us power—if we know how to use it well."
