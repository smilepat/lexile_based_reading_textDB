A habitat gives an animal food, water, and shelter. There are several important types of habitats. Forests are home to many animals. Bears, deer, and squirrels all live in forests. Trees give them food and a safe place to hide. The forest floor is covered with leaves, and many insects live there too. Oceans are another large habitat. Fish, whales, and dolphins swim in the ocean. Some sea animals live near the top of the water because they need air. Others live deep below where it is very dark and cold. Deserts are hot and dry, but some animals still live there. Camels can go a long time without water, so they do well in the desert. Lizards hide under rocks during the day because the sun is too strong. The Arctic is one of the coldest habitats on Earth. Polar bears have thick fur, so they stay warm. Penguins live in large groups and huddle together for warmth. Every animal is special and fits its habitat in an important way. Scientists study habitats to understand how animals survive. Protecting these places is important for all living things.",21,9.6,A1/A2,수업,2026-02-03,Present tense expository; academic vocabulary (habitat/shelter/process/protect); structured by habitat type; cause-effect reasoning
