However, the first dinner with her host family challenged that assumption entirely. They sat in prolonged silence between courses, which initially made her uncomfortable. Subsequently, she learned that Danish families valued quiet reflection during meals rather than constant conversation. Furthermore, her host sister explained that silence was considered a sign of mutual comfort, not awkwardness. This revelation transformed how Jisoo understood the relationship between communication and cultural identity.",6,17.2,B1,수업,2026-02-03,Cross-cultural narrative with embedded clauses; discourse markers (however/subsequently/furthermore); abstract cultural reasoning
L900-NAR-200-001,900-1100,960,Upper Secondary,중3,Narrative,Coming of Age,201,Medium,"The summer before high school, Minho discovered that the world operated according to rules nobody had explicitly explained to him. It began when his grandfather, who had always seemed invincible, was hospitalized with a condition that the doctors described as serious but manageable. Consequently, Minho found himself responsible for the family's small bookshop, a task that demanded skills he had never been required to develop. Customers would ask questions he could not answer, and suppliers would negotiate terms he barely understood. Nevertheless, each difficult interaction taught him something valuable about human nature and commerce. He observed that patience, rather than knowledge alone, determined whether a negotiation succeeded. Furthermore, he recognized that admitting ignorance often earned more respect than pretending to possess expertise. By September, when his grandfather finally returned, Minho had undergone a transformation that was difficult to articulate. The boy who had spent the summer reluctantly managing a bookshop had developed into someone who understood that maturity was not granted by age but was cultivated through the accumulation of responsibility and the willingness to confront uncertainty.",8,25.1,B1/B2,수업,2026-02-03,Coming-of-age narrative with nominalization; cause-effect reasoning; complex embedded clauses; abstract reflection on maturity
L900-NAR-350-001,900-1100,1000,Upper Secondary,고1,Narrative,The Weight of a Promise,348,Long,"Three years had passed since Yuna promised her late grandmother that she would preserve the family's traditional pottery workshop. At the time, the commitment had seemed manageable, even noble. However, the reality of maintaining a centuries-old craft in an era dominated by mass production proved far more challenging than she had anticipated. The workshop, situated in a village where the population had declined substantially, attracted fewer visitors with each passing season. Financial pressures mounted, and several relatives suggested that selling the property would constitute the most practical decision. Nevertheless, Yuna remained determined, convinced that abandoning the workshop would represent a betrayal of her grandmother's legacy. She began researching methods to modernize the business without compromising its traditional essence. Subsequently, she established an online presence, documenting the intricate process of creating each piece by hand. The response exceeded her expectations considerably. People from distant cities expressed fascination with the craftsmanship that distinguished handmade pottery from factory-produced alternatives. Furthermore, a university professor specializing in cultural heritage contacted her, proposing a collaboration that would bring students to the workshop for educational residencies. This partnership generated both revenue and renewed interest in the art form. Despite these achievements, Yuna occasionally questioned whether her interpretation of the promise aligned with what her grandmother had truly intended. Was preservation about maintaining everything exactly as it had been, or was adaptation itself a form of honoring tradition? The tension between these perspectives kept her awake on certain nights, wrestling with implications she could not easily resolve. Consequently, she decided to create a new line of pottery that incorporated contemporary designs while employing exclusively traditional techniques. This compromise, she believed, acknowledged that heritage must evolve to survive. Whether her grandmother would have approved remained uncertain, but Yuna had come to accept that the weight of a promise often lay not in its fulfillment but in the sincerity of the effort to honor it.",16,21.8,B1/B2,다독,2026-02-03,Extended narrative exploring promise and legacy; subjunctive mood; nominalization; abstract reasoning about tradition vs. modernity; complex embedded clauses throughout

L900-EXP-100-001,900-1100,970,Upper Secondary,중3,Expository,Sleep Science,102,Short,"Recent scientific investigations have revealed that sleep performs functions far more complex than merely providing physical rest. During the deepest stages of sleep, the brain actively consolidates memories, transferring information from short-term to long-term storage. Furthermore, researchers have identified a mechanism called the glymphatic system, which removes toxic waste products that accumulate during waking hours. Consequently, chronic sleep deprivation has been correlated with impaired cognitive performance and an increased risk of neurological disorders. These findings suggest that the hypothesis linking adequate sleep to overall mental health is supported by substantial evidence.",5,20.4,B1/B2,수업,2026-02-03,Scientific expository with domain-specific vocabulary (glymphatic/neurological); cause-effect structure; discourse markers; nominalization
L900-EXP-200-001,900-1100,1020,Upper Secondary,고1,Expository,Artificial Intelligence Ethics,198,Medium,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has generated profound ethical questions that society must address with considerable urgency. One fundamental concern involves algorithmic bias, a phenomenon in which AI systems reproduce and amplify existing social prejudices because they are trained on data that reflects historical discrimination. Consequently, automated hiring tools have been documented rejecting qualified candidates based on characteristics that should be irrelevant to job performance. Furthermore, the deployment of facial recognition technology raises significant privacy implications, particularly when governments utilize such systems for surveillance without adequate oversight. Nevertheless, proponents of AI development argue that these technologies offer substantial benefits, including improved medical diagnostics and more efficient resource allocation. The ethical challenge, therefore, lies not in whether AI should be developed but in how its implementation can be governed responsibly. Scholars in the field have proposed several frameworks for addressing these concerns. One approach emphasizes transparency, requiring that organizations disclose when algorithmic systems are being employed in consequential decisions. Another framework advocates for the establishment of independent regulatory bodies that would evaluate AI applications before their deployment in sensitive contexts. The resolution of these ethical dilemmas will ultimately require collaboration between technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and the communities most affected by these technologies.",10,19.8,B1/B2,수업,2026-02-03,Expository on AI ethics with problem-solution structure; academic vocabulary (algorithmic/deployment/implications); multiple discourse markers; nominalization throughout
L900-EXP-350-001,900-1100,1060,Upper Secondary,고1,Expository,The Psychology of Decision Making,352,Long,"The psychology of decision making has been extensively studied since the mid-twentieth century, yielding insights that challenge the traditional assumption that humans are fundamentally rational agents. Research conducted by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky demonstrated that cognitive biases systematically distort how individuals evaluate options and assess probabilities. Their work established that people rely on mental shortcuts, termed heuristics, which although efficient often produce predictable errors in judgment. One particularly influential finding concerns the anchoring effect, whereby an initial piece of information disproportionately influences subsequent estimates, even when that information is entirely arbitrary. For instance, experiments have shown that asking participants whether a particular value is higher or lower than a random number significantly affects their final numerical estimates. Furthermore, the framing effect reveals that the manner in which options are presented substantially alters preferences. When a medical treatment is described as having a ninety percent survival rate, individuals respond more favorably than when the identical treatment is described as having a ten percent mortality rate. Consequently, the implications for fields such as public health communication, marketing, and policy design are considerable. Nevertheless, awareness of these biases does not automatically eliminate their influence. Studies have demonstrated that even trained professionals, including physicians and financial analysts, remain susceptible to systematic errors when operating under conditions of uncertainty or time pressure. This finding has prompted researchers to investigate whether structured decision-making frameworks can mitigate the impact of cognitive biases. Evidence suggests that techniques such as deliberate consideration of alternative perspectives and the implementation of standardized evaluation criteria can improve decision quality. However, the effectiveness of these interventions varies depending on the complexity of the decision and the emotional investment of the individual involved. The field continues to evolve, with contemporary research exploring how social and cultural factors interact with cognitive processes to shape the decisions that ultimately define human behavior and institutional outcomes.",14,25.1,B1/B2,다독,2026-02-03,Extended expository on decision psychology; heavy nominalization; domain-specific terms (heuristics/anchoring/framing); cause-effect and compare-contrast structures; academic discourse markers throughout

Stigma remains the most substantial obstacle, as individuals experiencing psychological distress frequently avoid seeking professional assistance due to fear of social judgment. Furthermore, access to qualified mental health professionals is limited in numerous regions, particularly in rural areas where facilities are inadequate. Consequently, organizations advocating for mental health awareness emphasize the importance of early intervention and the normalization of conversations surrounding psychological well-being. Education programs implemented in schools have shown measurable effectiveness in reducing stigma among adolescents.",5,20.2,B1,수업,2026-02-03,Informational text on mental health; problem-solution structure; academic vocabulary; discourse markers (furthermore/consequently); nominalization
L900-INF-200-001,900-1100,980,Upper Secondary,고1,Informational,Renewable Energy,203,Medium,"The global transition toward renewable energy sources has accelerated significantly over the past decade, driven by growing concerns about climate change and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves. Solar and wind power have emerged as the most rapidly expanding sectors, with installation costs declining by approximately seventy percent since 2010. This reduction has made renewable energy increasingly competitive with traditional power generation methods in many markets. Nevertheless, the integration of renewable sources into existing electrical grids presents substantial technical challenges. Because solar and wind energy production fluctuates depending on weather conditions, maintaining a stable and reliable power supply requires sophisticated storage solutions. Battery technology, particularly lithium-ion systems, has advanced considerably, yet current storage capacity remains insufficient for managing extended periods of low renewable output. Furthermore, the infrastructure required for widespread adoption demands significant investment in transmission networks that can efficiently distribute energy from production sites to population centers. Despite these obstacles, numerous countries have established ambitious targets for renewable energy adoption. Germany, for example, has committed to generating eighty percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Similarly, South Korea has implemented policies designed to substantially increase its renewable energy capacity. The correlation between governmental policy support and successful energy transition has been documented extensively, suggesting that political commitment constitutes an essential factor in determining whether nations achieve their environmental objectives.",10,20.3,B1/B2,수업,2026-02-03,Informational text on renewable energy; cause-effect structure; statistical data integration; discourse markers; domain-specific vocabulary (infrastructure/transmission/correlation)
L900-ARG-100-001,900-1100,990,Upper Secondary,고1,Argumentative,Privacy vs Security,104,Short,"The tension between individual privacy and national security has intensified as governments expand digital surveillance programs. Authorities argue that monitoring electronic communications is essential for preventing terrorist activities and organized crime. Nevertheless, civil liberties organizations contend that mass surveillance fundamentally undermines the democratic principles it claims to protect. When citizens are aware that their communications are being monitored, they may engage in self-censorship, which consequently diminishes the free exchange of ideas that democratic societies require. Furthermore, historical evidence demonstrates that surveillance powers, once established, are frequently expanded beyond their original intended scope. Therefore, robust judicial oversight must accompany any security measures to prevent potential abuse.",6,17.3,B1/B2,수업,2026-02-03,Argumentative text on privacy vs security; compare-contrast structure; discourse markers (nevertheless/consequently/furthermore/therefore); abstract democratic reasoning
L900-ARG-200-001,900-1100,1040,Upper Secondary,고1,Argumentative,Universal Basic Income,202,Medium,"Universal basic income, a policy whereby governments provide all citizens with a regular unconditional payment, has generated considerable debate among economists and policymakers. Proponents argue that such a program would address the growing economic insecurity caused by automation and technological displacement. Furthermore, they contend that eliminating the complex bureaucratic structures associated with traditional welfare systems would reduce administrative costs substantially. Evidence from pilot programs conducted in Finland and Canada suggests that recipients of basic income payments experienced improved mental health and were more likely to pursue education or entrepreneurial ventures. Nevertheless, opponents raise significant objections to the proposal. The most prominent concern involves the considerable fiscal burden that universal payments would impose on government budgets. Critics argue that funding such a program would necessitate either substantial tax increases or the redistribution of resources from other essential public services. Additionally, some economists hypothesize that guaranteed income could reduce workforce participation, potentially undermining economic productivity. However, this claim is not consistently supported by the available empirical data. The resolution of this debate will likely depend on whether societies prioritize economic efficiency or the broader objective of ensuring that all citizens can meet their fundamental needs. Consequently, the discussion surrounding universal basic income reflects deeper philosophical questions about the responsibilities that governments bear toward their populations.",10,20.2,B1/B2,수업,2026-02-03,Argumentative text on UBI; compare-contrast with evidence; discourse markers; domain-specific terms (fiscal/bureaucratic/empirical); nominalization; abstract reasoning about policy
L900-ARG-350-001,900-1100,1080,Upper Secondary,고1,Argumentative,Animal Testing,351,Long,"The ethical legitimacy of animal testing remains one of the most contentious issues in contemporary scientific discourse. Each year, millions of animals are subjected to experimental procedures in laboratories worldwide, primarily for the purposes of pharmaceutical development and safety evaluation. Proponents of animal testing argue that it has been instrumental in achieving numerous medical breakthroughs, including the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and surgical techniques that have saved countless human lives. Furthermore, they maintain that current regulations require researchers to minimize animal suffering and that no adequate alternative exists for testing the complex biological interactions that occur within living organisms. Nevertheless, opponents present compelling arguments that challenge the ethical and scientific foundations of animal experimentation. From a moral perspective, critics contend that the capacity of animals to experience pain and distress imposes an obligation on humans to avoid inflicting unnecessary suffering, regardless of the potential benefits. The philosophical principle that sentient beings possess inherent rights that should not be violated for utilitarian purposes has gained considerable support among ethicists. Additionally, the scientific validity of animal testing has been increasingly questioned. Research has demonstrated that approximately ninety percent of drugs that prove effective in animal trials subsequently fail in human clinical trials, suggesting that the correlation between animal and human biological responses is less reliable than previously assumed. Consequently, investment in alternative methodologies has accelerated. Innovations such as organ-on-a-chip technology, computer modeling, and advanced cell culture techniques offer promising approaches that could eventually replace animal experimentation. These methods not only address ethical concerns but may also provide more accurate predictions of human biological responses. However, the transition from animal testing to alternative methods cannot occur immediately, as regulatory frameworks and scientific protocols require substantial revision. Therefore, a pragmatic approach would involve establishing clear timelines for the reduction of animal testing while simultaneously increasing funding for the development and validation of alternative technologies. Such a strategy would acknowledge both the current limitations of available alternatives and the ethical imperative to minimize animal suffering as expeditiously as possible.",15,23.4,B1/B2,다독,2026-02-03,Extended argumentative text on animal testing; problem-solution structure; subjunctive and conditional reasoning; heavy nominalization; domain-specific vocabulary (pharmaceutical/utilitarian/methodologies); balanced perspective with discourse markers throughout

His reading glasses rested on the kitchen table beside a newspaper folded to the crossword puzzle, three clues still unanswered. These ordinary objects, previously insignificant, had been transformed by loss into artifacts that demanded reverence. She could not bring herself to move them, as though their displacement would constitute a second, more permanent departure. Nevertheless, the season continued its indifferent progression. Spring arrived without consulting anyone's grief, pushing green shoots through the garden soil her father had cultivated with such meticulous care. She observed the plants emerging and recognized in their persistence something that resembled, if not hope, then at least the stubborn continuation of life beyond individual sorrow. Consequently, she began tending the garden, not because the grief had diminished but because she understood that nurturing what he had planted was a form of conversation with his memory. Each morning, she would kneel in the soil and speak quietly about the day ahead, about the weather, about the small developments she noticed among the growing plants. The neighbors, who witnessed this ritual, may have considered it peculiar. However, she had discovered that resilience was not the absence of pain but rather the cultivation of meaning within it.
