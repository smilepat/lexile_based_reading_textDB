L700-NAR-100-001,700-900,780,Middle School,중1,Narrative,The New Student,103,Short,"A new student named Marco arrived at Minjun's school on Monday morning. He came from Brazil and spoke very little Korean. During lunch, Minjun noticed Marco sitting alone in the cafeteria. He walked over and sat beside him. At first, they used simple English words and hand gestures to communicate. Marco showed Minjun pictures of his hometown on his phone. The colorful buildings and wide beaches looked amazing. By the end of the week, Marco had joined Minjun's friend group. They discovered that friendship doesn't always need perfect words — sometimes a smile is enough.",10,10.3,A2/B1,수업,2026-02-01,Short narrative - 우정 주제
L700-NAR-200-001,700-900,820,Middle School,중2,Narrative,The Lost Notebook,198,Medium,"Soyeon had always kept a notebook filled with her drawings and private thoughts. She carried it everywhere — to school, to the park, and even to family dinners. One Thursday afternoon, she realized the notebook was gone. She searched her backpack three times, checked under her desk, and asked every classmate she could find. Nobody had seen it. That evening, Soyeon could barely eat dinner. Her mother noticed her quiet mood and asked what was wrong. Soyeon explained about the lost notebook, expecting her mother to say it was just a notebook. Instead, her mother said something surprising. She told Soyeon that when she was young, she had lost her diary too, and it felt like losing a piece of herself. The next morning, Soyeon found the notebook sitting on her desk at school. A sticky note on the cover read: I found this in the library. Your drawings are beautiful. Soyeon never discovered who returned it, but she felt grateful. She realized that even strangers sometimes care about the things that matter to us.",17,11.6,A2/B1,수업,2026-02-01,Medium narrative - 감정 표현
L700-NAR-350-001,700-900,850,Middle School,중2,Narrative,The Mountain Trail,347,Long,"Last summer, Jihoon went hiking with his father in the mountains near their hometown. It was their first trip together in over a year because his father had been working overseas. Jihoon felt a mixture of excitement and awkwardness as they started walking up the trail early in the morning. The path was steep and covered with loose rocks. After about thirty minutes, Jihoon's legs began to ache. He wanted to stop, but his father kept walking ahead without looking back. Jihoon felt frustrated. He wondered if his father even noticed how tired he was. When they reached a flat area halfway up the mountain, his father finally stopped. He pulled two water bottles from his backpack and handed one to Jihoon. They sat on a large rock and looked out at the valley below. The view was spectacular — green trees stretched as far as they could see, and a thin river sparkled in the distance. His father broke the silence first. He admitted that he felt guilty about being away for so long. He said the hike was his way of spending quality time together, but he realized he had been walking too fast. Jihoon was surprised by his father's honesty. He told his father that he didn't mind the difficult trail. What mattered was that they were there together. They continued the hike at a slower pace, talking about school, friends, and their favorite movies. By the time they reached the summit, Jihoon felt closer to his father than he had in months. The view from the top was breathtaking, but what Jihoon remembered most was not the scenery. It was the feeling of walking side by side with someone he had missed deeply. On the way down, his father suggested they make hiking a monthly tradition. Jihoon agreed immediately, already looking forward to the next trip.",25,13.9,A2/B1,다독,2026-02-01,Long narrative - 가족 관계

L700-EXP-100-001,700-900,800,Middle School,중2,Expository,How Volcanoes Form,105,Short,"Volcanoes form when hot melted rock called magma rises from deep inside the Earth. The Earth's outer layer is made up of large pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving, although very slowly. When two plates push against each other or pull apart, cracks form in the surface. Magma pushes through these cracks and reaches the surface as lava. Over time, layers of cooled lava build up and create the cone shape that most people picture when they think of a volcano. Some volcanoes erupt violently with ash and fire, while others release lava slowly and quietly. Scientists study volcanoes carefully to predict eruptions and protect nearby communities.",10,10.5,A2/B1,수업,2026-02-01,Short expository - 과학 설명
L700-EXP-200-001,700-900,830,Middle School,중2,Expository,The Science of Color,195,Medium,"Colors are not actually part of the objects we see. Instead, color is the way our eyes and brain interpret different wavelengths of light. When sunlight hits an object, the object absorbs some wavelengths of light and reflects others. The wavelengths that bounce back to our eyes are what we see as color. For example, a red apple absorbs most wavelengths except red, which it reflects toward us. White objects reflect almost all wavelengths, while black objects absorb nearly all of them. This is why wearing black clothes in summer feels hotter than wearing white ones. The human eye contains special cells called cones that detect three primary colors of light: red, green, and blue. Our brain mixes these signals to create the millions of colors we experience every day. Interestingly, some animals see colors very differently from humans. Bees can see ultraviolet light, which is invisible to us, and it helps them find flowers. Dogs, on the other hand, see fewer colors than humans do. Understanding how color works has practical applications in many fields, from art and design to technology and medicine.",16,12.2,A2/B1,수업,2026-02-01,Medium expository - 과학 원리
L700-INF-100-001,700-900,790,Middle School,중1,Informational,Recycling in South Korea,98,Short,"South Korea is one of the world's leading countries in recycling. The government introduced strict recycling rules in the 1990s that require citizens to separate their waste into several categories. Most neighborhoods have designated areas where residents must sort their trash into food waste, plastics, paper, glass, and general waste. The food waste is often turned into animal feed or fertilizer. As a result of these efforts, South Korea now recycles more than half of its total waste. Many other countries are studying Korea's system as a model for improving their own recycling programs.",8,12.3,A2/B1,수업,2026-02-01,Short informational - 사회 이슈
L700-INF-200-001,700-900,840,Middle School,중2,Informational,The Rise of Electric Cars,204,Medium,"Electric cars are becoming increasingly common on roads around the world. Unlike traditional vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel, electric cars use batteries that can be recharged at home or at public charging stations. The number of electric vehicles sold globally has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by concerns about air pollution and climate change. Governments in many countries now offer financial benefits to people who buy electric cars, such as tax reductions and free parking in certain areas. South Korea has been actively building more charging stations throughout the country to encourage people to switch from gas-powered cars. However, electric cars still face several challenges. The batteries are expensive to produce and replace, and charging takes longer than filling a gas tank. In rural areas, there are often too few charging stations for electric cars to be practical. Some experts also point out that the electricity used to charge these vehicles may come from power plants that burn fossil fuels, which still creates pollution. Despite these issues, many automobile companies plan to stop producing gasoline-powered cars within the next two decades. The shift to electric vehicles appears to be an important step in reducing harmful emissions and creating cleaner cities.",17,12.0,B1,수업,2026-02-01,Medium informational - 기술/환경
L700-ARG-200-001,700-900,860,Middle School,중2,Argumentative,School Uniforms,196,Medium,"Many students complain about having to wear school uniforms every day. They argue that uniforms limit their freedom of expression and make everyone look the same. While these feelings are understandable, school uniforms actually provide several important benefits that students may not immediately recognize. First, uniforms create a sense of equality among students. When everyone wears the same clothes, it becomes harder to judge others based on their family's income or fashion choices. This can reduce bullying and social pressure related to appearance. Second, uniforms save time and reduce stress in the morning. Students do not need to spend time deciding what to wear, which means they can focus on preparing for their classes instead. Third, research from several countries suggests that schools with uniform policies tend to have fewer discipline problems and better academic performance. Of course, students should have opportunities to express their individuality through other means, such as art, sports, and extracurricular activities. However, the evidence suggests that the advantages of school uniforms outweigh the disadvantages. Rather than viewing uniforms as a restriction, students might consider them as a tool that supports a more focused and fair learning environment.",16,12.3,B1,수업,2026-02-01,Medium argumentative - 학교 규칙

Its paint is peeling, and one leg is slightly shorter than the others, making it wobble when you sit down. But I love that bench. I sit there every afternoon and watch the clouds change shape above the basketball court. Sometimes I bring a book. Sometimes I just sit and think. My friends ask me why I don't join them in the classroom during break. I tell them that the bench listens better than most people do.

Flowers grew wherever they pleased — roses tangled with wild grass, and tomato plants leaned lazily against the wooden fence. My mother sometimes suggested that Grandmother should hire someone to clean it up, but Grandmother always refused. She said a perfect garden was a boring garden. I spent many summer afternoons helping her water the plants. She taught me the names of every flower, though I forgot most of them by the following week. What I remember instead is the way she hummed while she worked, a low melody that seemed to come from somewhere deep inside her memory. When Grandmother passed away two years ago, the family discussed what to do with the house. Everyone agreed to sell it, and the new owners replaced the garden with a parking area. I understood why. Land is expensive, and a messy garden has little practical value. But sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can still see the sunlight falling through the leaves and hear her humming. I realize now that the garden was never really about the flowers. It was about the time we spent together among them, learning that some of the most valuable things in life resist being organized.",17,11.7,A2/B1,다독,2026-02-01,Medium literary - 추억/가족
