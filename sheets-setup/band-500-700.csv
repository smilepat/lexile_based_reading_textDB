When pressure builds up beneath the surface, an eruption can occur. During an eruption, hot lava flows down the sides of the volcano while ash and gas shoot into the sky. There are three main types of volcanoes that scientists have identified. Shield volcanoes, which are found in places like Hawaii, have gentle slopes and produce slow-moving lava. Stratovolcanoes are tall and steep, and they can cause violent eruptions. Cinder cone volcanoes are the smallest type, and they are built from pieces of lava that cool in the air. Volcanoes can be dangerous, although they also provide benefits to the environment. Volcanic soil is extremely rich in nutrients, which helps plants grow well. Many communities that live near volcanoes depend on this fertile land for farming. Scientists who study volcanoes are called volcanologists. They use special tools to monitor volcanic activity and compare data from different eruptions. Their research helps predict when a volcano might erupt, so people in nearby areas can evacuate safely. Although we cannot stop eruptions, understanding volcanoes allows us to prepare for them.",16,12.4,A2/B1,수업,2026-02-03,Full range of complex sentence structures; relative clauses with that which and who; subordinate clauses with when while although and so; academic vocabulary includes environment compare result identified monitor

When forests are cut down or oceans become polluted, animals lose the habitats that they need to survive. The giant panda, which lives in the bamboo forests of China, was once close to extinction. However, conservation programs have helped its population grow. People who work to protect endangered animals create safe environments where these creatures can recover. If we compare the results of conservation efforts over the past twenty years, we can see real progress.

L500-INF-200-001,500-700,640,Transitional,초6,Informational,Space Exploration,201,Medium,"Space exploration has fascinated humans for centuries, although traveling beyond Earth only became possible in the twentieth century. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, which was the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth. This event sparked a competition between nations that wanted to explore space. When astronaut Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969, it was a historic moment that inspired millions of people. Since then, scientists have sent robots to Mars, discovered new planets outside our solar system, and built the International Space Station. The space station, which orbits Earth every ninety minutes, is a laboratory where astronauts from different countries conduct experiments. They study how the human body reacts to living in space, and they compare results to find better ways to protect astronauts on long missions. Recently, private companies have joined the effort to explore space. Some plan to send tourists into orbit, while others are developing rockets that could carry humans to Mars. If these missions succeed, the way we think about space travel will change completely. Although the challenges are enormous, each discovery brings us closer to understanding the universe. Space exploration teaches us that when humans work together, they can achieve things that once seemed impossible.",16,12.6,A2/B1,수업,2026-02-03,Rich use of relative clauses with which that and who; subordinate clauses with when while if and although; academic vocabulary includes launched artificial competition discovered environments compare results conduct experiments

Students who spend long hours on homework often feel tired and stressed. When children have no free time, they cannot discover hobbies or enjoy being with their families. Although some teachers argue that homework helps students practice, research shows that too much homework does not always improve results. If schools reduced the amount of homework, students could use that time for creative activities and exercise.

L500-ARG-200-001,500-700,660,Transitional,초6,Argumentative,Screen Time for Kids,202,Medium,"Many parents worry about the amount of time that their children spend in front of screens. While some screen time can be educational, too much may cause problems for young people. Studies show that children who stare at screens for several hours each day are more likely to have trouble sleeping. They also tend to exercise less, which affects their physical health. However, it would be wrong to say that all screen time is harmful. Educational programs and apps that teach coding, science, or languages can be valuable tools for learning. The key is finding a balance between screen activities and other experiences. If families set clear rules about when and how long children can use devices, the results are usually positive. For example, some experts recommend that kids take a fifteen-minute break after every hour of screen use. Parents who encourage outdoor play and reading alongside screen time help their children develop healthy habits. Although technology is an important part of modern life, children also need time to talk with friends, explore nature, and use their imagination. When we compare children who have balanced routines with those who do not, the difference in well-being is significant. A thoughtful approach to screen time benefits the whole family.",15,13.5,A2/B1,수업,2026-02-03,Full range of relative and subordinate clauses; academic vocabulary includes environment compare results significant valuable approach recommend; persuasive structure with evidence and counterargument

Its thick branches stretched out like arms that wanted to embrace the sky. Every student who attended the school knew the tree well, although few understood its true importance. In spring, the tree produced bright green leaves that danced whenever the wind blew. Birds that nested in its branches filled the morning air with song. During summer, children gathered in the cool shade while they shared stories and laughter. When autumn arrived, the leaves turned golden and red before floating gently to the ground. The old tree became quieter in winter, although it never lost its dignity. One year, the school board announced plans to cut down the tree so that a new parking lot could be built. The students, who loved the tree deeply, decided to take action. They wrote letters, created posters, and organized a community meeting. Although many adults initially supported the construction plan, the children's passion changed their minds. The result was a compromise that protected the tree while still improving the school grounds.
