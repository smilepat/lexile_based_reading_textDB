Standing before the house decades later, Margaret discovered the door had always been green — a fact confirmed by every photograph her mother had kept. The memory, vivid and detailed, was entirely fabricated, a reconstruction her mind had assembled from fragments of desire and imagination. What unsettled her was not the error itself but the certainty with which she had held it. If this one recollection could be so fundamentally wrong, she wondered, how many other memories, those cherished narratives that constituted her sense of self, were equally unreliable?",10,10.2,B2,수업,2026-02-03,Explores reconstructive nature of memory through personal revelation; appositives and reduced clauses used throughout

The compound she had synthesized appeared to reverse cognitive decline in every trial subject, a breakthrough that pharmaceutical companies would value at billions. Yet a discrepancy troubled her. In three of the forty trials, subjects had exhibited brief but severe cardiac episodes — incidents that, while statistically insignificant, suggested an inherent risk her methodology had not fully addressed. Her supervisor, a man whose reputation depended on securing the next round of funding, urged her to publish immediately, dismissing the anomalies as irrelevant noise. The scientific community, he argued, would benefit more from rapid disclosure than from prolonged caution. Sato understood his reasoning, and she recognized that delay might allow a competing laboratory to claim priority. Nevertheless, she could not reconcile the utilitarian calculus with her own ethical framework. Publishing incomplete findings, however promising, presupposed that the potential to save thousands justified concealing a risk that might harm a few. She saved the file without submitting it and began designing a new series of trials, accepting that the cost of integrity might be her career.",18,11.0,B2/C1,수업,2026-02-03,Multi-layered ethical dilemma in scientific research; features nominalization and hedging language; CSAT-style implicit moral reasoning

The prisoner's dilemma, perhaps the paradigm's most celebrated model, demonstrates how individually rational decisions can produce collectively suboptimal outcomes. Two suspects, each incentivized to betray the other, tend to choose mutual defection despite the fact that cooperation would yield a superior result for both. This discrepancy between individual and collective rationality has profound implications for economics, political science, and evolutionary biology, challenging the assumption that rational self-interest invariably leads to efficient social outcomes.",7,14.7,B2/C1,수업,2026-02-03,Introduces game theory fundamentals; uses nominalization and academic hedging; CSAT-style logical structure
L1100-EXP-200-001,1100-1300,1220,Pre-CSAT,고3,Expository,Language and Thought,201,Medium,"The relationship between language and thought has long been a subject of scholarly debate, with positions ranging from strong linguistic determinism to the view that cognition is entirely independent of linguistic structure. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, in its strongest form, posits that the language one speaks determines the boundaries of one's conceptual world. This claim, however, appears to overstate the case. Research conducted among speakers of Hopi, a language once thought to lack temporal markers, revealed that its users do in fact perceive and reason about time, albeit through categories that differ from those encoded in Indo-European languages. Such findings suggest a weaker but still significant relationship: language does not determine thought, yet it arguably shapes habitual patterns of attention and categorization. Consider the example of color perception. Languages that possess distinct terms for light and dark blue, as Russian does, tend to facilitate faster discrimination between those hues in experimental settings. The implication is not that speakers of other languages cannot perceive the difference but rather that linguistic categories create cognitive shortcuts, reducing the processing effort required for distinctions that one's language renders salient. This nuanced position, often termed linguistic relativity, acknowledges the influence of language on cognition without presupposing that thought is imprisoned within grammatical structures.",18,11.2,B2/C1,수업,2026-02-03,Explores Sapir-Whorf hypothesis with concession-rebuttal structure; hedging and nominalization throughout; inference required
L1100-EXP-350-001,1100-1300,1260,Pre-CSAT,고3,Expository,The Paradox of Choice,348,Long,"Modern consumer societies operate under the assumption that expanding the range of available options invariably enhances individual well-being. This premise, deeply embedded in free-market ideology, appears intuitively sound: more choices should logically permit closer alignment between preferences and outcomes. Yet research in behavioral economics and psychology suggests that the relationship between choice and satisfaction is considerably more complex than such reasoning presupposes. Psychologist Barry Schwartz, drawing on extensive experimental evidence, has argued that beyond a certain threshold, an abundance of options tends to produce anxiety rather than empowerment, a phenomenon he terms the paradox of choice. When confronted with thirty varieties of jam rather than six, consumers in a well-known study were significantly less likely to make any purchase at all. Those who did choose reported lower satisfaction with their selections, apparently because the awareness of foregone alternatives generated persistent doubt. This pattern, replicated across domains from retirement planning to medical decision-making, reveals a fundamental discrepancy between economic models of rational choice and the psychological reality of human decision-making. Several mechanisms appear to account for this phenomenon. First, an excess of options increases the cognitive burden of comparison, depleting the mental resources available for evaluation. Second, the availability of many alternatives elevates expectations, making any single outcome seem inadequate by comparison. Third, and perhaps most significantly, abundant choice intensifies the experience of regret, since the decision-maker bears personal responsibility for having selected one option over numerous others. The implications extend beyond consumer behavior into broader questions about institutional design and public policy. If unlimited choice does not maximize well-being, then arguably, organizations and governments have reason to implement what Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler call choice architecture — the deliberate structuring of decision environments to facilitate better outcomes without eliminating freedom. Such an approach acknowledges an uncomfortable truth that pure libertarian frameworks tend to resist: human rationality, bounded by cognitive limitations and emotional vulnerabilities, often benefits from carefully designed constraints rather than unrestricted freedom.",24,14.5,B2/C1,다독,2026-02-03,Comprehensive analysis of choice paradox with multi-layered argumentation; integrates psychology and economics; CSAT-style implicit thesis requiring inference

China's gross domestic product, adjusted for purchasing power parity, now rivals that of the United States, while India's economy, though smaller in absolute terms, has exhibited consistently higher growth rates.

L1100-INF-200-001,1100-1300,1240,Pre-CSAT,고3,Informational,Climate Policy Debates,202,Medium,"International climate policy has entered a phase characterized by sharp disagreements over the distribution of responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Developed nations, historically the largest emitters of carbon dioxide, tend to advocate for universal reduction targets, arguing that the urgency of the crisis demands collective action regardless of historical contribution. Developing nations, conversely, contend that imposing equivalent obligations on economies still striving for industrialization presupposes an unjust equivalence between those who created the problem and those who bear its most severe consequences. The 2015 Paris Agreement attempted to bridge this divide through nationally determined contributions, a framework permitting each country to set its own targets. While this approach achieved unprecedented participation, critics argue that it lacks the enforcement mechanisms necessary to ensure compliance. Moreover, the aggregate commitments submitted thus far appear insufficient to limit global temperature increases to the agreed threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. A further complication arises from the inherent tension between short-term economic interests and long-term environmental sustainability. Nations dependent on fossil fuel exports face a fundamental discrepancy between their economic models and the decarbonization agenda. Arguably, resolving this impasse will require not merely diplomatic negotiation but a paradigm shift in how societies conceptualize economic growth itself.",17,11.9,B2/C1,수업,2026-02-03,Balanced overview of climate policy tensions; concession-rebuttal structure with hedging; CSAT-style inference required for main argument
L1100-ARG-100-001,1100-1300,1180,Pre-CSAT,고2,Argumentative,Technology and Human Agency,104,Short,"The claim that digital technology enhances human agency arguably oversimplifies a far more ambiguous reality. While smartphones and algorithmic platforms appear to expand access to information and opportunities, they simultaneously constrain choice through curated content feeds and predictive systems that presuppose user preferences. This paradox — increased surface-level freedom accompanied by diminished autonomy in deeper cognitive processes — suggests that technology's relationship with human agency is not one of simple empowerment. Rather, it tends to restructure the very framework within which decisions are made, rendering the concept of free choice itself problematic in the digital age.",8,13.0,B2/C1,수업,2026-02-03,Argues technology constrains rather than enhances agency; inverted reasoning structure; hedging and academic vocabulary
L1100-ARG-200-001,1100-1300,1200,Pre-CSAT,고3,Argumentative,Cultural Relativism,199,Medium,"Cultural relativism, the principle that moral standards are valid only within their originating cultural context, appears to offer a tolerant and intellectually humble alternative to ethnocentrism. By refusing to judge foreign practices according to external criteria, relativists arguably avoid the arrogance inherent in imposing one civilization's values upon another. This position, however, contains a fundamental discrepancy that its proponents tend to overlook. If all moral frameworks are equally valid, then the framework that condemns human rights abuses holds no greater authority than the framework that permits them. Taken to its logical conclusion, cultural relativism presupposes that external criticism of practices such as forced labor or systematic discrimination is inherently illegitimate, a position that most advocates of the doctrine would themselves reject. The deeper problem lies in the assumption that cultures constitute monolithic, internally consistent entities whose moral codes are uniformly endorsed by all members. In reality, every society contains dissenting voices, individuals who challenge dominant norms from within. To silence their appeals for external solidarity by invoking cultural sovereignty is not an act of tolerance but an endorsement of the status quo. A more defensible position, arguably, is one that acknowledges cultural diversity while maintaining that certain fundamental protections — those pertaining to bodily autonomy, freedom from torture, and basic subsistence — transcend cultural boundaries, not because they are Western values imposed universally, but because they address conditions of suffering that human beings across all cultures recognize.",19,10.5,B2/C1,수업,2026-02-03,Critiques cultural relativism with concession-rebuttal structure; multi-layered argumentation with logical connectors; CSAT-level inference required
L1100-ARG-350-001,1100-1300,1280,Pre-CSAT,고3,Argumentative,Genetic Engineering,352,Long,"Advances in genetic engineering, particularly the development of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology, have intensified debates over the ethical boundaries of human intervention in biological processes. Proponents argue that the capacity to modify genetic material offers unprecedented opportunities to eliminate hereditary diseases, enhance agricultural productivity, and address environmental challenges that conventional methods have failed to resolve. Such optimism, while not entirely unfounded, tends to overlook a constellation of ethical, social, and epistemological concerns that demand careful examination. The most immediate objection concerns unintended consequences. Genetic systems are characterized by extraordinary complexity, with individual genes frequently influencing multiple traits through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Editing a gene to eliminate one disorder may inadvertently disrupt regulatory pathways that serve protective functions elsewhere. This inherent unpredictability arguably constitutes sufficient reason for caution, particularly when modifications are heritable and therefore irreversible across generations. A second and perhaps more profound concern involves the social implications of genetic enhancement. If the technology becomes commercially available, access will inevitably be stratified by economic class, creating a paradigm in which biological advantage compounds existing social inequalities. Children of affluent families, already benefiting from superior education and healthcare, would gain additional cognitive and physical advantages encoded at the genetic level. The resulting discrepancy between enhanced and unenhanced populations could fundamentally undermine the democratic presupposition of equal human potential. Critics of this argument tend to respond that inequalities already exist in every domain and that denying beneficial technology to all in order to prevent disparate access represents a morally incoherent position. This rebuttal, however, presupposes that genetic modification is comparable to other forms of advantage, an assumption that arguably does not withstand scrutiny. Unlike educational privilege, which can in principle be redistributed through policy reform, genetic modifications are embedded in the organism itself, creating permanent biological hierarchies resistant to social intervention. The most responsible course, therefore, is not to prohibit genetic research but to establish robust international regulatory frameworks that ensure equitable access, mandate long-term safety studies, and preserve the distinction between therapeutic interventions — those that alleviate suffering — and enhancement projects that risk transforming human diversity into engineered uniformity.",25,14.1,B2/C1,다독,2026-02-03,Comprehensive argument on genetic engineering ethics; multi-layered with concession-rebuttal and inverted structures; heavy nominalization and hedging; CSAT-style implicit thesis

The buildings appeared smaller than she remembered, the trees less grand, the light less golden. Nostalgia, she reflected, was not merely a longing for the past but a form of editing — a process through which memory selects, enhances, and reconstructs experience until the original bears little resemblance to the version preserved in the mind. She had loved that street, or rather, she had loved what her memory had made of it: a place where afternoons expanded infinitely and consequence had not yet been invented. The real street, captured in the photograph's indifferent honesty, was ordinary — a row of aging storefronts beneath a sky that was simply gray, not the luminous silver her recollection had insisted upon. What troubled her was not the discrepancy itself but the realization that nostalgia served a function she had not previously acknowledged. By idealizing the past, it rendered the present inadequate, creating a perpetual sense of displacement, a feeling that one's true home existed only in a time that had never actually occurred. She placed the photograph back in the drawer, understanding now that the ache she felt was not for the past but for an illusion her mind had constructed to make the passage of time seem like a loss rather than what it arguably was — simply change.",20,10.0,B2/C1,수업,2026-02-03,Literary meditation on nostalgia as cognitive editing; uses appositives and reduced clauses; multi-layered reflection with implicit insight requiring inference
